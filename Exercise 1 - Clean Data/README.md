This ‘Dummy’ dataset was cleaned by removing samples with NA values, a clean table was the outputted, in addition to an output table of the removed samples and a calculation of the percentage of samples that remained. There were some NA values in the ‘dummy’ data, which meant some samples failed for ‘some’ measurement due to low quality.
