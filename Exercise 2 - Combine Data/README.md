# Exercise 2: Combine Data – Task Outline

Six data table files (Sex, Age, Height, BMI, GT and Disease) of ‘dummy’ data were combined together into a single table (by sample_ID) with missing values labelled as “NA” as in the input data of the previous exercise. A loop was used to load and process each file consecutively to minimise errors and increase efficiency.
